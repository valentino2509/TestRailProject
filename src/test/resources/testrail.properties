# api_endpoint - the FULL URL of the TestRail instance (e.g. "https://service-ip/testrail/") you must use when hosting a TestRail Instance locally
# clientId - the client ID you use when using a "hosted" version of TestRail (e.g. (https://somecompany.testrail.com/")

# Use either api_endpoint or clientId. If you use both, api_endpoint will be ignored, and the code will assume you're using clientId in a "hosted" TestRail Instance
